Detailed Railway Credential Walkthrough:

1. Login to Railway (https://railway.app)
2. Click on your project that has the MySQL database
3. In your project dashboard, find and click on the MySQL service (usually shows CPU/RAM usage)

4. Look for these interface elements:
   - Primary tab labeled "Connect" - This is most common location
   - Search field typing "connection" or "mysql"
   - "Connection Info" button
   - Section labeled "MySQL Connection URL"

5. The credentials will be in this format:
   mysql://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:[PORT]/[DATABASE]

6. If you still don't see it:
   - Click "Variables" tab - might be listed as separate vars
   - Click "Settings" > look for "Database" section
   - Check your project's email notifications (Railway sometimes sends credentials via email)

7. Once found, copy/paste EXACTLY into your .env file:
   DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:pass@yamanote.proxy.rlwy.net:12345/activite_ujem"
