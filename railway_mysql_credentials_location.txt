Step-by-Step to Find MySQL Credentials in Railway:

1. Go to Railway dashboard (https://railway.app)
2. Select your project containing MySQL
3. Click on the MySQL service (usually shows RAM usage)

4. Click on the "Connect" tab - this is where credentials are

5. Under "MySQL Connection URL" you'll find:
   mysql://username:password@host:port/database

6. If not in "Connect" tab, check:
   - "Variables" tab
   - "Settings" > "Connection"
   - "MySQL" section

The credentials are typically found under "Connect" tab first, with format:
mysql://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]

Save these exact values to your .env file as:
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@host:port/database"
